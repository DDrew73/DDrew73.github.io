      <h6><b>Geometric Optimization of Microfabricated Silicon Electrodes for Corona Discharge Based Electrohydrodynamic Thrusters</b><br><b>Daniel S Drew</b>, Kristofer S J Pister, <i>Micromachines, Microplasmas issue</i></h5>
      <h7>Electrohydrodynamic thrust is an emerging propulsion mechanism for flying insect-scale robots. There is a need to both minimize the operating voltage and maximize the output force when designing microfabricated electrodes for use in these robots. In this work, an array of hybrid wire-needle and grid electrode geometries were fabricated and characterized to attempt to minimize both corona discharge onset voltage and thrust loss factor. Statistical analysis of this dataset was performed to screen for factors with significant effects. An optimized emitter electrode decreased onset voltage by 22 percent. Loss factor was found to vary significantly (as much as 30 percent) based on collector grid geometric parameters without affecting discharge characteristics. The results from this study can be used to drive further optimization of thrusters, with the final goal of providing a path towards autonomous flying microrobots powered by atmospheric ion engines.

      <h6><b>First Takeoff of a Flying Microrobot With No Moving Parts</b><br><b>Daniel S Drew</b>, Kristofer S J Pister, <i>MARSS 2017, to appear</i></h5>
      <h7>In this work, we demonstrate an insect-scale robot capable of vertical takeoff using electrohydrodynamic thrust, a mechanism with no natural analogue. The 10mg, 1.8cm by 1.8cm ``ionocraft'' operates at about 2400 volts and has a thrust to weight ratio of approximately 10. Feasibility of using individually addressable thrusters in a quadcoptor-esque manner for attitude control is demonstrated qualitatively. A combination of design choices in the microfabricated silicon electrodes and a machine-fabricated external fixture allow for reproducible hand-assembly of the microrobot.

      <h6><b>Future Mesh Networked Pico Air Vehicles</b><br><b>Daniel S Drew</b>, Brian Kilberg, Kristofer S J Pister, <i>ICUAS 2017, to appear</i></h5>
      <h7>Taken together, recent advances in microelectromechanical systems, wireless mesh networks, digital circuits, and battery technology have made the notion of autonomous pico air vehicles viable. In this work we describe the core technologies enabling these future vehicles as well propose two possible future platforms. We draw on recent research on high thrust density atmospheric ion thrusters, microfabricated silicon control surfaces, and extremely low mass and power mesh networking nodes. Using the same open-source network implementation as we have already demonstrated in larger UAVs, these flying microrobots will open up a new application space where unobtrusiveness and high data granularity are vital.

      <h6><b>First Steps of a Millimeter-scale Walking Silicon Robot</b><br>Daniel S Contreras, <b>Daniel S Drew</b>, Kristofer S J Pister, <i>TRANSDUCERS 2017, to appear</i></h5>
      <h7>We present the first evidence of locomotion from a walking silicon robot based on a two degree-of-freedom robot leg with the largest force and displacement of any electrostatically-driven SOI leg to date. The peak vertical force is five times the weight of the robot. Using a new approach, the robot stands with the chip vertically and has demonstrated its ability to lift itself and move forward while actuating the leg on the ground under tethered power and control. This is the simplest process (2 mask SOI) for making an electrostatic SOI robot that has been demonstrated.

      <h6><b>First Thrust from a Microfabricated Atmospheric Ion Engine</b><br><b>Daniel S Drew</b>, Daniel Contreras, Kristofer S J Pister, <i>MEMS 2017</i></h6>
      <h7>The bulk of current research in the realm of pico air vehicles has focused on biologically inspired propulsion mechanisms. In this work we investigate the use of electrohydrodynamic thrust produced by a microfabricated corona discharge device as a mechanism to create flying microrobots with no moving parts.  Electrodes of various geometries are fabricated from a silicon-on-insulator wafer with a two mask process.  Electrical characterization is performed to analyze the effect of inter-electrode gap and emitter electrode width on corona discharge and compare findings to simulation.  Outlet air velocity and thrust are directly measured to analyze the effects of collector electrode geometry on performance.  A roughly 100 cubic millimeter, 2.5mg thruster is assembled with a thrust to weight ratio exceeding 20.

      <h7>The recent proliferation of easy to use electronic components and toolkits has introduced a large number of novices to designing and building electronic projects. Nevertheless, debugging circuits remains a difficult and time-consuming task. This paper presents a novel debugging tool for electronic design projects, the Toastboard, that aims to reduce debugging time by improving upon the standard paradigm of point-wise circuit measurements. Ubiquitous instrumentation allows for immediate visualization of an entire breadboard's state, meaning users can diagnose problems based on a wealth of data instead of having to form a single hypothesis and plan before taking a measurement. Basic connectivity information is displayed visually on the circuit itself and quantitative data is displayed on the accompanying web interface. Software-based testing functions further lower the expertise threshold for efficient debugging by diagnosing classes of circuit errors automatically. In an informal study, participants found the detailed, pervasive, and context-rich data from our tool helpful and potentially time-saving.

      <h7>Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) thrusters, which use ionized air under the influence of an electric field to produce a force, have been investigated for the purposes of flying vehicles for decade. This work focuses on leveraging the precision and speed of rapid prototyping techniques such as 3D printing and laser engraving in order to rigorously investigate this phenomenon at scales relevant to microrobot research.

          <li><i> "Gnat" robotics </i></li>
          <p>The other day I wanted to move a big houseplant of mine to a spot where it would get more midday sun. I'm not home enough during the early afternoon to really remember where the sun shines brightest. What's a simple and cheap way to figure this out? My engineer brain says to prototype some sort of photodiode array with Arduino and log the results... but what if I could just take a handful of tiny robots out of my pocket and throw them into the room? This isn't a problem that requires much intelligence, mobility, or lifetime; all they have to do is spread out in one room and record light every 30 minutes. I won't even pick them up when they're done, I'll let them "self-destruct."

          <li><i> How do humans interact with swarms? </i></li>
          <p>I hate when people fly quadcoptors near my head, especially the little ones that make the extremely high pitched rotor noises (must be the primal fear of eye gouging). Just imagine when autonomous swarm technology matures and we have thousands of them flying around at once. Right now the research is heavily focused on industrial and commercial applications, but even then <i>someone</i> is going to have to interact with these swarms. How do you interact with Honda's ASIMO? You can shake its hand. How do you interact with a Boston Dynamics' Spot? Maybe pat it on the head. Interacting with a swarm of buzzing insects is out of the realm of human experience. </p>
          <p>I want to use virtual reality as a tool to simulate human interaction with autonomous microrobot swarms. How can a swarm express its intentions? How should it use situational context to modify its own behavior?</p>

          <li><i> Big data from lots of small things </i></li>
          <p> One estimate is that there are 10 quintrillion insects on earth at any one time- that's 10^19. The trillion-sensor movement as currently conceptualized relies on human installation and maintenance, with industrial pushes largely towards longer device lifetime so humans have to go service motes less often. Let's provide each of these sensor motes with its own mobility platform; we already know from nature that there is an insect to suit every environment and that they have no trouble spreading. Moving beyond the almost cliche application example of "search and rescue," how can we use these swarms to change the world?
