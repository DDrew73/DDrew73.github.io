          In the near future, swarms of millimeter scale robots will be vital and common tools in industrial, commercial, and
          personal settings. The research effort to get us there is inherently interdisciplinary and represents a tremendous
          opportunity for collaboration, for training a new generation of interdisciplinary investigators, and for forging new
          ties between the worlds of industry, academia, and design; I look forward to pushing it forward.

      <h7>The limited in-flight battery lifetime of centimeterscale flying robots is a major barrier to their deployment, especially in applications which take advantage of their ability to reach high vantage points. In this paper, we motivate the need for application-specific power electronics solutions for electroadhesive perching, develop a useful figure of merit (the “specific voltage”) for comparing and guiding efforts, and walk through the design methodology of a system implementation. We conclude by showing that this high voltage power supply enables, for the first time in the literature, tetherless electroadhesive perching of a commercial micro quadrotor.

      <h7>A swarm of robots can accomplish more than the sum of its parts, and swarm systems will soon see increased use in applications ranging from tangible interfaces to search and rescue teams. However, effective human control of robot swarms has been shown to be demonstrably more difficult than controlling a single robot, and swarm-specific interactions methodologies are relatively underexplored. As we envision even non-expert users will have more daily in-person encounters with different numbers of robots in the future, we present a user-defined set of control interactions for tabletop swarm robots derived from an elicitation study.

      <h7>To address the problem of rapidly generating low-level controllers without domain knowledge or a priori knowledge of system dynamics, we propose using model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) trained on few minutes of automatically generated data. In this paper, we explore the capabilities of MBRL on a Crazyflie quadrotor with rapid dynamics where existing classical control schemes offer a baseline against the new method's performance. To our knowledge, this is the first use of MBRL for low-level controlled hover of a quadrotor using only on-board sensors, direct motor input signals, and no initial dynamics knowledge.

      <h7>This work presents an insect-scale microrobot that flies silently and with no mechanical moving parts, using a mechanism with no analogue in the natural world: electrohydrodynamic thrust produced by ions generated via corona discharge. For the first time, attitude and acceleration data is continuously collected from takeoff and sustained flight of a 2cm x 2cm, 30mg ``ionocraft'' carrying a 37mg 9-axis commercial IMU on FlexPCB payload, with external tethers for power and data transfer. The ionocraft's steady state thrust versus voltage profile, dynamic response to a time-varying signal around a high voltage DC bias point, and aerodynamic drag at incident angles around 90 degrees are measured. These experimental measurements, as well as measured IMU sensor noise, are inserted into a Matlab Simulink simulation environment. Simulation shows controlled hovering and planned flight in arbitrary straight trajectories in the X-Y plane.

      <h7>This paper presents a new development environment designed to illuminate the boundary between embedded code and circuits. Bifröst automatically instruments and captures the progress of the user's code, variable values, and the electrical and bus activity occurring at the interface between the processor and the circuit it operates in. This data is displayed in a linked visualization that allows navigation through time and program execution, enabling comparisons between variables in code and signals in circuits. Automatic checks can detect low-level hardware configuration and protocol issues, while user-authored checks can test particular application semantics. In an exploratory study with ten participants, we investigated how Bifröst influences debugging workflows.

      <h7> In this work, an array of hybrid wire-needle and grid electrode geometries were fabricated and characterized to attempt to minimize both corona discharge onset voltage and thrust loss factor. Statistical analysis of this dataset was performed to screen for factors with significant effects. An optimized emitter electrode decreased onset voltage by 22%. Loss factor was found to vary significantly (as much as 30%) based on collector grid geometric parameters without affecting discharge characteristics. The results from this study can be used to drive further optimization of thrusters, with the final goal of providing a path towards autonomous flying microrobots powered by atmospheric ion engines.}

      <h7>In this work, we demonstrate an insect-scale robot capable of vertical takeoff using electrohydrodynamic thrust, a mechanism with no natural analogue. The 10mg, 1.8cm by 1.8cm "ionocraft" operates at about 2400 volts and has a thrust to weight ratio of approximately 10. Feasibility of using individually addressable thrusters in a quadcoptor-esque manner for attitude control is demonstrated qualitatively. A combination of design choices in the microfabricated silicon electrodes and a machine-fabricated external fixture allow for reproducible hand-assembly of the microrobot.

      <h6><b>Future Mesh Networked Pico Air Vehicles</b><br><b>Daniel S Drew</b>, Brian Kilberg, Kristofer S J Pister, <i>ICUAS 2017</i></h5>
      <h7>Taken together, recent advances in microelectromechanical systems, wireless mesh networks, digital circuits, and battery technology have made the notion of autonomous pico air vehicles viable. In this work we describe the core technologies enabling these future vehicles as well propose two possible future platforms. We draw on recent research on high thrust density atmospheric ion thrusters, microfabricated silicon control surfaces, and extremely low mass and power mesh networking nodes. Using the same open-source network implementation as we have already demonstrated in larger UAVs, these flying microrobots will open up a new application space where unobtrusiveness and high data granularity are vital.

      <h6><b>First Steps of a Millimeter-scale Walking Silicon Robot</b><br>Daniel S Contreras, <b>Daniel S Drew</b>, Kristofer S J Pister, <i>TRANSDUCERS 2017</i></h5>
      <h7>We present the first evidence of locomotion from a walking silicon robot based on a two degree-of-freedom robot leg with the largest force and displacement of any electrostatically-driven SOI leg to date. The peak vertical force is five times the weight of the robot. Using a new approach, the robot stands with the chip vertically and has demonstrated its ability to lift itself and move forward while actuating the leg on the ground under tethered power and control. This is the simplest process (2 mask SOI) for making an electrostatic SOI robot that has been demonstrated.

      <h6><b>First Thrust from a Microfabricated Atmospheric Ion Engine</b><br><b>Daniel S Drew</b>, Daniel Contreras, Kristofer S J Pister, <i>MEMS 2017</i></h6>
      <h7>The bulk of current research in the realm of pico air vehicles has focused on biologically inspired propulsion mechanisms. In this work we investigate the use of electrohydrodynamic thrust produced by a microfabricated corona discharge device as a mechanism to create flying microrobots with no moving parts.  Electrodes of various geometries are fabricated from a silicon-on-insulator wafer with a two mask process.  Electrical characterization is performed to analyze the effect of inter-electrode gap and emitter electrode width on corona discharge and compare findings to simulation.  Outlet air velocity and thrust are directly measured to analyze the effects of collector electrode geometry on performance.  A roughly 100 cubic millimeter, 2.5mg thruster is assembled with a thrust to weight ratio exceeding 20.

      <h6><b>The Toastboard: Ubiquitous Instrumentation and Automated Checking of Breadboarded Circuits</b><br><b>Daniel S Drew</b>, Julie Newcomb, William McGrath, Filip Maksimovic, David Mellis, Bjoern Hartmann, <i>UIST 2016</i></h6>
      <h7>The recent proliferation of easy to use electronic components and toolkits has introduced a large number of novices to designing and building electronic projects. Nevertheless, debugging circuits remains a difficult and time-consuming task. This paper presents a novel debugging tool for electronic design projects, the Toastboard, that aims to reduce debugging time by improving upon the standard paradigm of point-wise circuit measurements. Ubiquitous instrumentation allows for immediate visualization of an entire breadboard's state, meaning users can diagnose problems based on a wealth of data instead of having to form a single hypothesis and plan before taking a measurement. Basic connectivity information is displayed visually on the circuit itself and quantitative data is displayed on the accompanying web interface. Software-based testing functions further lower the expertise threshold for efficient debugging by diagnosing classes of circuit errors automatically. In an informal study, participants found the detailed, pervasive, and context-rich data from our tool helpful and potentially time-saving.

      <h6><b>High Power Density Electrohydrodynamic Jet Arrays Using Folded Laser Microfabricated Electrodes</b><br><b>Daniel S Drew</b>, Sean Follmer, <i>Hilton Head 2020</i></h6>
      <h7>Miniaturized electrohydrodynamic propulsion devices have extremely high power densities due to the small required electrode gap. To lift useful payloads, however, prior work has largely implemented wider total thruster area, effectively decreasing the volumetric power density of the system. This paper shows that through vertical integration of ducted EHD jets we can near linearly increase the propulsive force with number of stages while maintaining high power densities.

      <h6><b>Takeoff of a Flying Microrobot With COTS Sensor Payload Using Electrohydrodynamic Thrust Produced by Sub-millimeter Corona Discharge</b><br><b>Daniel S Drew</b>, Kristofer S J Pister, <i>Hilton Head 2018</i></h6>
      <h7>This paper demonstrates the first flying microrobot using electrohydrodynamic thrusters, or ionocraft, to successfully take off while carrying an onboard commercial sensor package. The 13.6mg, 1.8cm by 1.8cm ionocraft is shown to take off while carrying a 40mg Flex PCB with 9-axis IMU and associated passives while tethered to a power supply. A new emitter electrode design has decreased corona onset voltage by over 30% and takeoff voltage by over 20% from previous efforts. Thrust density scaling with increasing numbers of emitter wires, continued geometric scaling for decreased operating voltage, device lifetime improvement via thin film deposition, and new assembly techniques are all explored.

      <h7>Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) thrusters, which use ionized air under the influence of an electric field to produce a force, have been investigated for the purposes of flying vehicles for decade. This work focuses on leveraging the precision and speed of rapid prototyping techniques such as 3D printing and laser engraving in order to rigorously investigate this phenomenon at scales relevant to microrobot research.

          <li><i> "Gnat" robotics </i></li>
          <p>The other day I wanted to move a big houseplant of mine to a spot where it would get more midday sun. I'm not home enough during the early afternoon to really remember where the sun shines brightest. What's a simple and cheap way to figure this out? My engineer brain says to prototype some sort of photodiode array with Arduino and log the results... but what if I could just take a handful of tiny robots out of my pocket and throw them into the room? This isn't a problem that requires much intelligence, mobility, or lifetime; all they have to do is spread out in one room and record light every 30 minutes. I won't even pick them up when they're done, I'll let them "self-destruct."
          <br><i>Flynn, Anita M. "Gnat robots (and how they will change robotics)." (1987).</i>

          <li><i> How do humans interact with swarms? </i></li>
          <p>I hate when people fly quadcoptors near my head, especially the little ones that make the extremely high pitched rotor noises (must be the primal fear of eye gouging). Just imagine when autonomous swarm technology matures and we have thousands of them flying around at once. Right now the research is heavily focused on industrial and commercial applications, but even then <i>someone</i> is going to have to interact with these swarms. How do you interact with Honda's ASIMO? You can shake its hand. How do you interact with a Boston Dynamics Spot? Maybe pat it on the head. Interacting with a swarm of buzzing insects is out of the realm of human experience. </p>
          <p>I want to use virtual reality as a tool to simulate human interaction with autonomous microrobot swarms. How can a swarm express its intentions? How should it use situational context to modify its own behavior?</p>

          <li><i> Big data from lots of small things </i></li>
          <p> One estimate is that there are 10 quintrillion insects on earth at any one time- that's 10^19. The trillion-sensor movement as currently conceptualized relies on human installation and maintenance, with industrial pushes largely towards longer device lifetime so humans have to go service motes less often. Let's provide each of these sensor motes with its own mobility platform; we already know from nature that there is an insect to suit every environment and that they have no trouble spreading. Moving beyond the (wildly important) application example of "search and rescue," how can we use these swarms to change the world?
